# Node.js Application Architecture

## Project Overview
This Node.js application follows best practices for building scalable and maintainable backend services. It uses a modular structure with separation of concerns, adhering to principles like microservices and MVC architecture. Each component of the application is independently maintainable, and the code is structured in such a way that it's easy to scale.

## Folder Structure

### /src
Contains all the source code of the application.

- **/components**: Each feature of the application has its own folder, containing:
  - **/entry-point**: Includes controllers, routes, and middleware for the feature.
  - **/domain**: Contains the business logic of the feature (e.g., services, validations).
  - **/data-access**: Deals with database access, repositories, and schemas.
  
- **/config**: Contains configuration files like database and server configurations.
  
- **/middlewares**: Contains global middleware for the application (e.g., authentication, error handling).
  
- **/utils**: Holds utility files like logging, error handling, and helper functions.

### Key Features
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each feature is independent and can be maintained separately. It promotes a scalable, modular approach.
- **Microservices-based Architecture**: Each feature behaves like an independent service and can be deployed and scaled independently.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling using middleware ensures consistency across the application.

## Design Decisions
- **Express.js** is used for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB** is used as the database, following a document-based structure.
- **JWT Authentication** is used to secure routes.
